Repo for Angel Hack 2016 

What Should I Do Today is a web application built by Patrick Lai and Wai-Lun Lau to help people find activities to do in cities all over the world with
just a few clicks. This is done by using the google maps and expedia APIs. The finished product can be found in index.html under the frontend folder.
(this was done at a hackathon, all code in 1 file was the way to go)
